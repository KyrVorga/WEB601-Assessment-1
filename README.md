# WEB601-Assessment-1

This is a prototype login system made for an assignment for WEB601. This repo is co-authored by Rhylei Tremlett and Xander Crocker.

## Setup
To run this application, first clone the repository onto your local machine.
Next, open a terminal in the project folder and run `$ npm install`.
Afterwards, create a .env file and enter the following:
  `
  PORT=3000
  TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
  API_SECRET=SUTI9NC
  `

Once that is done, run `$ node server.js` in the project root.
